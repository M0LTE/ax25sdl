//! Hand-written runtime types for the generated SDL pages.
//!
//! The `.g.rs` files in this crate are produced by
//! `codegen/src/Packet.Sdl.CodeGen.Rust` and reference the types
//! defined here via `use crate::types::*`. This file is **not**
//! generated — it's the analogue of `spec/go/ax25sdl/types.go`
//! and `spec/csharp/`'s hand-written shape, providing the language-
//! idiomatic structs the codegen targets.
//!
//! Empty-string / zero-int conventions are used in place of
//! `Option<…>` throughout, to keep the static initialisers
//! readable: a `Line` of `0` in an `ImplementationReference` means
//! "no line citation"; etc. A guard is an `&'static [GuardTerm]`
//! conjunction whose empty slice (`&[]`) means "no guard".
//!
//! This module is `no_std`-clean: every type is `Copy`, holds only
//! `&'static` borrows + scalars + the closed-set enums, and touches
//! no allocator. The crate is `#![no_std]` unless the default-on
//! `std` feature is enabled (which lights up the test harness).

// The closed typed sets (SP-010 / ADR-0002), generated from the spec
// catalogues and re-exported here so `ActionStep` / `TransitionSpec` /
// `GuardTerm` can name them. Carrying a typed enum member (not a raw
// `&str`) lets a consumer `match` exhaustively — a renamed or typo'd
// verb / atom / event becomes a compile error, not a runtime "unknown"
// throw. (Generated alongside this module; see crate::ax25_action_verb
// etc.)
